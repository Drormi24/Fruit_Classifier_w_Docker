# My 1st docker project
I am excited to release my 1st docker project wrapping a small Deep Learning fruit classifier.
Classifier is coded on a Jupiter notebook and based on eyantra fruits dataset utilizing PyTorch and based on LeNet5 model.
Model is adjusted for data structure a charachteristics (100x100, single channel). 
Data is splitted into train / test and uploaded using 2 pre-defined dataloaders. 
This is done in order to optimize batch size and running speed of 2 situations

In addition, I utilized Torchvision transformers on trainset images for improving learning process. 
Enjoy
